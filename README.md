# Red-Wine-Quality

# Libraries Used

  1. Pandas
  2. Numpy
  3. Scikit-Learn
  4. Seaborn
  5. Matplotlib

I used pandas for reading and manipulating data

I used numpy for using array

I used Scikit-Learn for building machine learning model

I used seaborn for visualizations

I used matplotlib for visualization and because seaborn plots are build using matplotlib

# Problem Statement

As we know that there are so many red wine brands in the market so need check the quality of red wine before consuming it. So i created a machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine.
