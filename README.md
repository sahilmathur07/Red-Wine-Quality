# Red-Wine-Quality

# Libraries Used

  1. Pandas
  2. Numpy
  3. Scikit-Learn
  4. Seaborn
  5. Matplotlib

I used pandas for reading and manipulating data

I used numpy for using array

I used Scikit-Learn for building machine learning model

I used seaborn for visualizations

I used matplotlib for visualization and because seaborn plots are build using matplotlib

# Problem Statement

As we know that there are so many red wine brands in the market so need check the quality of red wine before consuming it because if the quality of wine is low then it is harmful for our health. So i created a machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine.

# Approach

Above countplot shows that there are less wines with 3,4,7,8 quality and large number of 5 and 6 quality wines. So i combined 3,4,5 and 6,7,8 into High and Low Quality 

#  Machine Learning Algorithms used

I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier

# Results

Achieved a accuracy of 82% using Stacking Classifier
